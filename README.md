Control your Things.app tasks directly from Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other AI assistants using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What It Does

This MCP server lets AI assistants interact with your Things.app tasks on macOS. You can:

- **Create** new tasks and projects
- **Update** existing items 
- **View** your task database with detailed summaries
- **Schedule** tasks for specific dates
- **Organize** with areas, tags, and deadlines

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Things Authorization Token

For updating existing tasks, you need an authorization token:

1. Open **Things.app** on macOS
2. Go to **Things → Preferences → General** 
3. Check **"Enable Things URLs"**
4. Copy the authorization token that appears

### 2. Configure Your AI Assistant

<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "things": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@wenbopan/things-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor IDE</strong></summary>

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally:

```json
{
  "things": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@wenbopan/things-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "THINGS_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### 3. Restart Your AI Assistant

After configuration, restart your AI assistant to load the MCP server.
